In x86-64, instructions generally specify what size data to access from memory and then operate upon.

x86-64 Data Sizes

Integer
• 4 Sizes Defined
– Byte (B)
• 8-bits
– Word (W)
• 16-bits = 2 bytes
– Double word (L)
• 32-bits = 4 bytes
– Quad word (Q)
• 64-bits = 8 bytes

Floating Point
• 3 Sizes Defined
– Single (S)
• 32-bits = 4 bytes
– Double (D)
• 64-bits = 8 bytes
• (For a 32-bit data bus, a
double would be accessed
from memory in 2 reads)


Intel x86 Register Set
• 8-bit processors in late 1970s
– 4 registers for integer data: A, B, C, D
– 4 registers for address/pointers: SP (stack pointer), BP
(base pointer), SI (source index), DI (dest. index)
• 16-bit processors extended registers to 16-bits but
continued to support 8-bit access
– Use prefix/suffix to indicate size: AL referenced the lower
8-bits of register A, AH referenced the high 8-bits, AX
referenced the full 16-bit value
