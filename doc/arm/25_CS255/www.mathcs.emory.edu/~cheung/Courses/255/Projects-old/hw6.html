CS 255 - Computer Organization/Architecture I <BR>
Homework 6
</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>

Due date: See Class Webpage

<P>
Observe the <B> Emory Honor Code </B> when doing this (and all other) homework.

<H2>
1. Purpose of Assignment
</H2>
<P>
<UL>
 <UL>
 <LI> Refresher for linked list manipulation 
 <LI> Gain insight into linked list through assembler programming
 <LI> Prepare you for project 4 that uses recursion to manipulate linked lists.
 <LI> Prepare for midterm
</UL>
</UL>
<P>
<H2>
2. The Skeletal File
</H2>
<UL>
Since this assignment is about manipulating linked lists,
and it takes a lot of computer instructions to just create
 a linked list, to save the computation effect,
 I have "hand coded" <B>three</B> linked list in 
 the skeletal file used for this assignment.
<P>
You don't need to know the details how I did it.
All the information that you need to know in order to work 
 with the linked list are:
<P>
 <UL>
 <LI>  the structure of the linked list elements
 <LI>  the head of each of the linked lists.
 </UL>
<P>
First, get a <B>copy</B> of the skeletal file for this homework:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI> Skeletal hw6 project  file: <A HREF="hw6.s"> right click here and
	save in your CS255 project directory</A>.
 </UL>
<P>
To get a copy of the skeletal program file, 
 <B>right</B> click on the above hyper link -
 choose the <B><TT>Save As</TT></B> tab to save a copy.
Put the copy in your <B>cs255</B> project directory.

</UL>
<P>
<H2>
3. The Linked Lists
</H2>
<UL>

<P>
The linked lists that I hand coded is contained in the variable section
of the hw6.s file.
The variable section of the  skeletal program  contains:
<P>
<UL>
<TABLE bgcolor="lightcyan" BORDER="5">
<TR>
<TD>
<FONT color="blue">
<B>
<PRE>

   List list1;		// list1 points to the first list element of list1
			 (it contains the address of the first element of list 1)

   List list2;		// list2 points to the first list element of list2
			 (it contains the address of the first element of list 2)

   List list3;		// list3 points to the first list element of list3
			 (it contains the address of the first element of list 3)  
</PRE>
</B>
</FONT>
</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>
<P>

These 3 linked lists have <B><I>already been defined</I></B>
 so you must have faith in my ability to construct the linked list.
You just have to traverse and manipulate the lists.
You do not need to create list elements in this assignment (it will
 happen later) - just <B><I>manipulate</I></B> the list elements.

<P>
Each <B><I>objects</I></B> in the linked list
 has the following structure:
<PRE>
        +-------------+
        | int value   |   (4 bytes)
        +-------------+
        | List next   |   (4 bytes)
        +-------------+
</PRE>
In Java, the class definition of the List object would look like this:
<PRE>
	public class List
	{
	   int  value;
	   List next;
	}
</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>
4. Other variables that are already defined in the program
</H2>
<P>
<UL>
 There are other variables defined in the program that you need to
 use to complete the assignment.
<P>
<P>
<UL>
<TABLE bgcolor="yellow" BORDER="5">
<TR>
<TD>
<FONT color="blue">
<B>
<PRE>

  int answer;           // Used to store the answer

  List elem1;		// Points to a List element 
			// that you need to insert into List1

  List elem2;		// Points to a List element 
			// that you need to insert into List2

  List elem3;		// Points to a List element 
			// that you need to insert into List3    
</PRE>

</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>
5. Questions
</H2>
<P>
 <UL>
<P>
  The skeletal program has 5 sections, labeled as 
   <P>
  <UL>
  <LI> Q1, 
  <LI> Q2, 
  <LI> ..., 
  <LI> Q5
  </UL>
<P>
 The labels corresponds to questions 1 through 5.
 <P>
<P>
<UL>
<TABLE bgcolor="yellow" BORDER="5">
<TR>
<TD>
<FONT color="red">
<B>
  Write the assembler instructions the each answer in the corresponding
   section of the <TT>hw6.s</TT> file.
</B>
</FONT>
</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>
<P>




The assignment is as follows:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> After the label <B>Q1</B>, write 
	M68000 assembler instructions to do:
<B>
<PRE>
    answer = list1.value ;	
</PRE>
</B>
  The correct answer is:  1234
<P>
<LI> After the label <B>Q1</B>, write 
        M68000 assembler instructions to do:
<B>
<PRE>
    answer = list1.next.next.next.value ;
</PRE>
</B>
<P>

  The correct answer is:  2345
<P>
<LI> Insert elem1 at the <B>start</B> of list1
 <P>
 <UL>
 You will see list1 change and the first element is: 
<B>
<PRE>
    (7777, 314) -> ... etc
</PRE>
</B>
 </UL>
<P>
<LI> Insert elem2 as the <B>third element</B> in list2
 <P>
 <UL>
 You will see list2 change and the 3rd element is: 
<B>
<PRE>
     ... -> ... -> (8888, 314) -> ... etc
</PRE>
</B>
 </UL>
<P>
<LI> Insert elem3 at the <B>tail (end)</B> of list3
 <UL>
 You will see list3 change and the <B>last</B> element is: 
<B>
<PRE>
     ... -> ... -> ... -> (9999, 314)
</PRE>
</B>
 </UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> You <FONT COLOR="red"><B>must</B></FONT> use
  a while loop to determine the end of the list in Part 5.
  Do  <FONT COLOR="red"><B>not</B></FONT>
	look in the file and <B><I>count</I></B> the number of element
	in list3.
  (So do not cheat on yourself by determining the last element 
 in the list through counting the number of elements....)
 You will lose out on an opportunity to re-inforce your knowledge of linked list
 (and I <B>will</B> test your ability to work 
 with linked lists in the tests, so you will only be cheating on yourself)
</OL>
</UL>

<H2>
6. Running the program
</H2>

<P>

<OL>
<LI> First, get a copy of the EGTAPI debug file <TT>egt.hw6</TT>
    for this project:
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> egt.hw6 for homework 5 for a <B>Windows PC</B>:
     <A HREF="PC/egt.hw6">  click here </A>
 <LI> egt.hw6 for homework 5 for a <B>Mac/Linux PC</B>:
     <A HREF="egt.hw6">  click here </A>
 </UL>
<P>
 <B>Right</B> click on the above hyper link; and select "Save As".
Save it in the <B>same directory</B> as your hw6.s project file !
 <P>
<LI> run hw6 in EGTAPI.
 <P>
   You will see the <B>Linked List Watch</B> window pop up
	showing the 3 linked lists and 3 list elements.
   (list1, elem1, list2, elem2, list3, elem3)
 <P>
   You should also see the variable
   <B>answer</B> in the <B>Variable Watch</B> window.
 <P>
   For <B>Q1</B> and <B>Q2</B>, look at the variable
   <B>answer</B> in the <B>Variable Watch</B> window to see if
	your program is correct.
  <P>
  For <B>Q3</B>, <B>Q4</B> and <B>Q5</B>, look at the
	<B>Linked List Watch</B> window to check if your program is correct.

 <P>
<LI> First, run the program using the "Continue" button to quickly
	see if you have errors.
	It will run till the next break point and I have already
	setup the labels
	Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 and Stop as breakpoints, so the program should
	stop each time it completes one question.
  <P>
	When EGTAPI stops, look carefully at the results.
 <P>
 <LI> For Q1, you should see <B>answer = 1234</B>
 <P>
 <LI> For Q2, you should see <B>answer = 2345</B>
 <P>
 <LI> For Q3, Q4 and Q5, you should look in the Linked List Watch
	window to see if the linked list has been modified correctly -
	i.e., did you inserted the element in the right place.
 
 <P>
 <LI> The linked lists from questions Q3, Q4 and Q5 will also be printed
	to the termout0 output file
	(i.e., a file will be created named "termout").
    <P>
	This is mainly used by the grader to simplify grading.
	You have <B>much better debug information</B> available with <B>EGTAPI</B> 
	and do not need to concern yourself with the termout0 output
 <P>
<LI> When you see <TT>nop</TT> at the <B>Stop</B> label after Q5, 
     your program is done.
</OL>
 </UL>
<P>
<HR>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>
7. Turn in
</H2>
<P>
 <UL>
Turn in your program as hw6 using the <TT>/home/cs255000/turnin</TT> 
command (executed while you're in your cs255 directory):
<PRE>
       /home/cs255000/turnin  hw6.s  hw6
</PRE>

I want the source (so I can read it).
<B>DO NOT</B> turn in the executable or the object code !
</UL>
