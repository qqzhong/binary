<h2> <B> Statement of Policy on Homework Assignments </b> </h2>
</center>
<p>

Students will be graded partially on the basis of their
homework assignments. These homework
assignments are to be treated as examinations, and are
expected to be your <B>individual</B> work. While
discussions with other students in the course may be
permitted or encouraged by your instructor, you
should write your program yourself. 
Your instructor (and any teaching assistants assigned to
the course) will be glad to help you to the extent
that he or she feels reasonable.

<p>
Submissions based on other students solutions in prior
offerings of the course specifically violate these
guidelines, as do submissions prepared with the help of an outside "tutor".

<p>
You should take precautions to protect the confidentiality
of your work, do not collaborate on questions that you turn in
for a grade, do not show your solution to a fellow student,
not even after the due date for some students may have
receive extension.

<p>
All submissions should include a <B>comment</B> statement near
the top of the program of the form:

<p>
<tt>
	THIS HOMEWORK IS MY OWN WORK, IT WAS WRITTEN WITHOUT CONSULTING
    A TUTOR OR WORK WRITTEN BY OTHER STUDENTS - your name
</tt>
<p>
Cases of apparent plagiarism or collusion will be referred
to the Honor Council.
<P>
