How Linked List are Stored inside the Computer
<HR>
</H1>
<UL>
<P>
<LI> One of the few data structures that will become very clear in assembler
	is the linked list because you will need to manipulate the
	low level addresses to traverse the entire list
<P>
<LI> A computer program needs information to do its work (solve some problem)
 <P>
     A linked list is one of the many <B>data structures</B> that
	Computer Science has developed to manage/organize information
 <P>
     The linked list is a <B>dynamic</B> structure, i.e.,
	the number of elements in a linked list can <B>increase</B>
	and <B>decrease</B> in time
 <P>
     (In contrast, the <B>array</B> data structure  is <B>static</B>,
	number of elements stays constant)

<P>
<LI> Structure of a linked list <B>element</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> A linked list element <B>always</B> consists of 2 parts...
 <LI> A <B>data</B> part consisting of one or more variables
	that hold the actual information you want to stored
 <LI> A <B>linkage</B> part consisting of one or more <B>reference</B>
	variables that hold <B>addresses</B> of the <B>neighboring</B>
	linked list elements
 </UL>
<P>
Symbolically:
 <PRE>
    Linked list element:

    +-----------------------+
    |			    |
    |			    | <---- data part (variables that
    |			    |	    hold actually information
    |			    |	    that you want to store
    +-----------------------+
    |			    | <---- linkage part (reference variable
    |			    |	    containing address of neighboring
    +-----------------------+	    list elements
 </PRE>


<P>
<LI> Structure of a <B>linked list</B>
 <P>
 <UL>
 <LI> A linked list consists of zero or more
	linked list elements <B>chained</B> together
	by their <B>linkage</B> parts.
 <LI> The special reference value <B>null</B> indicates 
	"no more elements"
 <LI> The <B>data</B> parts of the elements chained would contain
	the actual information stored
 </UL>
<P>
Symbolically:
 <PRE>
    A simple linked list:

    +--------+    -->+--------+    -->+--------+
    | info1  |   /   | info2  |   /   | info3  |
    |        |  /    |        |  /    |        |
    +--------+ /     +--------+ /     +--------+
    | ref1   |-      | ref2   |-      | null   |
    +--------+       +--------+       +--------+
 </PRE>

<P>
<LI> The linked list elements are <B>linked</B> together by
	using <B>references</B> which are <B>addresses</B>
 <P>
   Each linked list element is located <B>somewhere</B> in memory, and
	thus, each linked list element has a <B>starting</B>
	memory address
 <P>
   The linkage <B>reference</B> variables contains the <B>address</B>
   of the next linked list element
 <P>
 <B>Example:</B> the above linked list of 3 element would be linked
	together as follows:
 <PRE>
 We have to make some assumptions to do the example.

 The assumptions are:
	First element of linked is is located at address 8000
	Second element of linked is is located at address 10000
	Third element of linked is is located at address 9000

 Memory:

 <UL>
 <LI> Notice that although I drew <B>arrows</B> from one linked list element
	to the next one, these arrows are just imaginary ones represented
	by the <B>address</B> value contained by the "ref" variables
 <LI> (A reference in Computer Science is the same as a memory address !)
 </UL>

<P>
<LI> To access the <B>entire</B> linked list (i.e., to
     access <B>all</B> elemenets in the linked list),
     you (only) need to know the <B>location</B> (<B>address</B>)
     of the <B>first</B> list element
 <P>
    That is why you need an extra variable usually called <B>head</B>
    that contains a reference (<B>address</B>)
    of the first element in the linked list:
